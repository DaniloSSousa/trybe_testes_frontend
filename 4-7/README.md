1 - Imagine that you are a person responsible for developing a page that serves as a reader of written content.

This written content can be a book page, a magazine report or an online newspaper note. To avoid having to think about the content of the page, use this link to generate the text for your page.

So far, nothing new, but this demand requires that you apply the readers to the page to improve their reading experience.

How people should have the power to change:

- Background color of the screen;
- Text color;
- Font size;
- Spacing between lines of text;
- Font type (font family).

These must be saved in such a way that, when returning to the page, as recorded that have been configured as applied to the screen.

Bonus
-----
- As properties described above are mandatory, but you can book any other property that you think is valid and that aims to improve the experience of the person who reads on your page.
