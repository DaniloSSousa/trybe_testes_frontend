PART 2
-------

1 - Create a function that receives a number and returns its factorial.

In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative number N, with the notation N !, is the product of all integers less than or equal to N. Example: 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.

2 - Create a function that receives a phrase and returns the largest word.

Example:

longestWord ("Antonio went to the bathroom and we don't know what happened") // returns 'happened'

3 - Create a page that contains:

A button to which an event listener will be associated;

A clickCount variable in the JavaScript file that accumulates the number of clicks on the button;

A field in HTML that updates the number of clicks on the button as the clickCount variable is updated.

4 - Create a JavaScript code with the following specification:

Don't forget to use template literals.

Function 1: Write a function that will receive a string as the first parameter. Your function should look for the letter x and replace it with the string you passed as the first parameter. Your function should return this new string.

String example:

“Tryber x here!

It's all right?".

An array with global scope, which is the scope of the JS file, in this case, containing five strings with their main skills.

Function 2: Write a function that will receive the string returned from Function 1 as a parameter. This function must concatenate the skills of the global array to the string that was passed to Function 2 via parameter. You must order the skills in alphabetical order. Your function should return this new string.

Example:

“Tryber x here!

All right?

My top five skills are:

JavaScript;
HTML; …
#goTrybe ”.
