1 - For today's first exercise, make a program that, given any value n, whether n > 1, print on the screen a square made of side asterisks of size n. For example:

1 n = 5
2
3 *****
4 *****
5 *****
6 *****
7 *****


2 - For the second exercise, do the same as before, but print a right triangle with 5 basic asterisks. For example:

1 n = 5
2
3 *
4 **
5 ***
6 ****
7 *****


3 - Now invert the side of the triangle. For example:

1 n = 5
2
3     *
4    **
5   ***
6  ****
7 *****


4 - Then, make a pyramid with n basic asterisks:

1 n = 5
2 
3   *
4  ***
5 *****
