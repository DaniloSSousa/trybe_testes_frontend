The purpose of these exercises is to put into practice what you just learned about DOM. Therefore, you must do the exercises using only JavaScript code, which must be inserted between the <script> and </script> tags.

For better organization, make commits to each completed task. Let's go to the exercises:

1 - Add the h1 tag with the text Exercise 4.5 - JavaScript DOM as a child of the body tag;

2 - Add the div tag with the main-content class as a child of the body tag;

3 - Add the div tag with the center-content class as a child of the div tag created in step 2;

4 - Add the p tag as a child of the div created in step 3 and place some text;

5 - Add the div tag with the left-content class as a child of the div tag created in step 2;

6 - Add the div tag with the right-content class as a child of the div tag created in step 2;

7 - Add an image with src set to https://picsum.photos/200 and small-image class. This element must be a child of the div created in step 5;

8 - Add an unordered list with the values ​​from 1 to 10 in full, that is, one, two, three, ... as list values. This list must be a child of the div created in step 6;

9 - Add 3 h3 tags, all children of the div created in step 2.


Now that you've created a lot, let's make some changes and removals:

1 - Add the title class to the created h1 tag;

2 - Add the description class in the 3 h3 tags created;

3 - Remove the div created in step 5 (the one with the left-content class). Use the .removeChild () function;

5 - Change the background color of the parent element of the div created in step 3 (the one that has the center-content class) to green;

6 - Remove the last two elements (nine and ten) from the list created in step 8.
